\section{Sparse matrices}

We say a matrix is {\em sparse} if the vast majority of the entries are
zero.  Because we only need to explicitly keep track of the nonzero
elements, sparse matrices require less than $O(n^2)$ storage, and we
can perform many operations more cheaply with sparse matrices than with
dense matrices.  In general, the cost to store a sparse matrix, and to
multiply a sparse matrix by a vector, is $O(\nnz(A))$, where $\nnz(A)$
is the {\em number of nonzeros} in $A$.

Two specific classes of sparse matrices are such ubiquitous building
blocks that it is worth pulling them out for special attention.
These are diagonal matrices and permutation matrices.  Many linear
algebra libraries also have support for {\em banded} matrices
(and sometimes for generalizations such as {\em skyline} matrices).
\matlab\ also provides explicit support for general sparse matrices
in which the nonzeros can appear in any position.

\subsection{Diagonal matrices}

A diagonal matrix is zero except for the entries on the diagonal.
We often associate a diagonal matrix with the vector of these entries,
and we will adopt in class the notational convention used in \matlab:
the operator $\ddiag$ maps a vector to the corresponding diagonal matrix,
and maps a matrix to the vector of diagonal entries.  For example,
for the vector and matrix
\[
  d = \begin{bmatrix} d_1 \\ d_2 \\ d_3 \end{bmatrix} \\
  D = \begin{bmatrix} d_1 & & \\ & d_2 & \\ & & d_3 \end{bmatrix}
\]
we would write $D = \ddiag(d)$ and $d = \ddiag(D)$.

The \matlab\ routine {\tt diag} forms a dense representation of a
diagonal matrix.  Next to {\tt inv}, it is one of the \matlab\ commands
that is most commonly poorly used.  The primary {\em good} use of
{\tt diag} is as the first term in a sum that builds a more complicated matrix.
But {\em multiplication} by a diagonal matrix should never go through the
{\tt diag} routine.  To multiple a diagonal matrix by a vector, the preferred
idiom is to use the elementwise multiplication operation, i.e.
\begin{lstlisting}
  y = diag(d) * x;  % Bad -- O(n^2) time and intermediate storage
  y = d .* x;  % Good -- equivalent, but O(n) time and space
\end{lstlisting}
To multiply a diagonal matrix by a matrix in \matlab, use the {\tt bsxfun}
command, e.g.
\begin{lstlisting}
  B = diag(d) * A;  % Bad -- left scaling in O(n^3) time
  C = A * diag(d);  % Bad -- right scaling in O(n^3) time
  B = bsxfun(@times, d, A);  % Good -- O(n^2) time
  C = bsxfun(@times, A, d.');  % Ditto
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Permutations}

A permutation matrix is a 0-1 matrix in which one appears exactly
once in each row and column.  We typically use $P$ or $\Pi$ to
denote permutation matrices; if there are two permutations in a
single expression, we might use $P$ and $Q$.

A permutation matrix is so named because it permutes the entries
of a vector.  As with diagonal matrices, it is usually best to
work with permutations implicitly in computational practice.
For any given permutation vector $P$, we can define an associated
mapping vector $p$ such that $p(i) = j$ iff $P_{ij} = 1$.  We can
then apply the permutation to a vector or matrix using \matlab's
indexing operations:
\begin{lstlisting}
  B = P*A;    % Straightforward, but slow if P is a dense rep'n
  C = A*P';
  B = A(p,:); % Better
  C = A(:,p);
\end{lstlisting}
To apply a transpose permutation, we would usually use the permuted
indexing on the destination rather than the source:
\begin{lstlisting}
  y = P'*x;  % Implies that P*y = x
  y(p) = x;  % Apply the transposed permutation via indexing
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Narrowly banded matrices}

If a matrix $A$ has zero entries outside a narrow band near the
diagonal, we say that $A$ is a {\em banded} matrix.  More precisely,
if $a_{ij} = 0$ for $j < i-k_1$ or $j > i+k_2$, we say that $A$
has {\em lower bandwidth} $k_1$ and {\em upper bandwidth} $k_2$.
The most common narrowly-banded matrices in matrix computations
(other than diagonal matrices) are {\em tridiagonal} matrices in
which $k_1 = k_2 = 1$.

In the conventional storage layout for band matrices (used by LAPACK)
the nonzero entries for a band matrix $A$ are stored in a packed
storage matrix $B$ such that each column of $B$ corresponds to a column
of $A$ and each row of $B$ corresponds to a nonzero (off-)diagonal of $A$.
For example,
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\
    & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44} & a_{45} \\
    & & a_{53} & a_{54} & a_{55}
  \end{bmatrix} \mapsto
  \begin{bmatrix}
    * & a_{12} & a_{23} & a_{34} & a_{45} \\
    a_{11} & a_{22} & a_{33} & a_{44} & a_{55} \\
    a_{21} & a_{32} & a_{43} & a_{54} & * \\
    a_{31} & a_{42} & a_{53} & * & *
  \end{bmatrix}
\]
\matlab\ does not provide easy specialized support for band matrices
(though it is possible to access the band matrix routines if you
are tricky).  Instead, the simplest way to work with narrowly banded
matrices in \matlab\ is to use a general sparse representation.

\subsection{General sparse matrices}

For diagonal and band matrices, we are able to store nonzero matrix
entries explicitly, but (as with the dense matrix format) the locations
of those nonzero entries in the matrix are implicit.  For permutation
matrices, the values of the nonzero entries are implicit (they are
always one), but we must store their positions explicitly.  In a
{\em general} sparse matrix format, we store both the positions and
the values of nonzero entries explicitly.

For input and output, \matlab\ uses a {\em coordinate} format for
sparse matrices consisting of three parallel arrays ({\tt i}, {\tt j},
and {\tt aij}).  Each entry in the parallel arrays represents a
nonzero in the matrix with value {\tt aij(k)} at row {\tt i(k)} and
column {\tt j(k)}.  For input, repeated entries with the same row and
column are allowed; in this case, all the entries for a given location
are summed together in the final matrix.  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}
  i = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]; % Row indices
  j = [2, 3, 4, 5, 5]; % Col indices
  v = [5, 8, 13, 21, 34]; % Entry values/contributions
  A = sparse(i,j,v,5,5); % 5-by-5 sparse matrix
  full(A) % Convert to dense format and display

  % Output:
  % ans =
  %
  %   0    5    0    0    0
  %   0    0    8    0    0
  %   0    0    0   13    0
  %   0    0    0    0   55
  %   0    0    0    0    0
\end{lstlisting}
This functionality is useful
in some applications (e.g.~for assembling finite element matrices).

Internally, \matlab\ uses a {\em compressed sparse column} format
for sparse matrices.  In this format, the row position and value for
each nonzero are stored in parallel arrays, in column-major
order (i.e.~all the elements of column $k$ appear before elements of
column $k+1$).  The column positions are not stored explicitly for
every element; instead, a {\em pointer array} indicates the offset
in the row and entry arrays of the start of the data for each column;
a pointer array entry at position $n+1$ indicates the total number
of nonzeros in the data structure.

The compressed sparse column format has some features that may not
be obvious at first:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  For very sparse matrices, multiplying a sparse format matrix by a
  vector is much faster than multiplying a dense format matrix by a
  vector --- but this is not true if a significant fraction of the
  matrix is nonzeros.  The tradeoff depends on the matrix size and
  machine details, but sparse matvecs will often have the same speed as ---
  or even be slower than --- dense matvecs when the sparsity is above a
  few percent.
\item
  Adding contributions into a sparse matrix is relatively slow,
  as each sum requires recomputing the sparse indexing data structure
  and reallocating memory.  To build up a sparse matrix as the sum of
  many components, it is usually best to use the coordinate form first.
\end{itemize}
In general, though, the sparse matrix format has a great deal to
recommend it for genuinely sparse matrices.  \matlab\ uses the sparse
matrix format not only for general sparse matrices, but also for the
special case of banded matrices.
